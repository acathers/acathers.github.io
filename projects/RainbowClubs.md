<h1>First project with webdev</h1>
This was my first project I ever accompolished collaboritively and in the realm of web development. There were a lot of learning pains going through it. At first everything seemed like a massive feat
then as I learned the tech stack a little better (Meteor and Semantic UI) everything seemed to go rather smoothly.
