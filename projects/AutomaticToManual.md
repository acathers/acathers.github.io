summary: When I was around sixteen, me and my cousin decided to convert our car from automatic to manual.

When I was younger and still had time to spare, me and my cousin took on a fairly massive project of converting our 1988 Honda Prelude from an automatic transmission to a manual transmission. It took around a month total to complete and was one of the most complex undertakings I had done at the time.

Starting out we found a slightly newer Honda Prelude that had front-end damage in our local junkyard. We spent a day there pulling the transmission and picking various other parts that we'd need to complete the conversion, such as center console, clutch pedal, and the master cylinder.

From there we had to pull the motor from the car we were going to put the new transmission into. We removed the old transmission and cleaned up the motor while we had it out. From there it was fairly straight forward, just a matter of remembering how everything went.
