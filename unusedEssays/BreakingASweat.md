<h2>What is Athletic Software Engineering?</h2>

This semester I've been introducted to an entirely new style of learning programming in the classroom called athletic software engineering(ASE). At first it sounded odd to me, since when I think of programming athleticism is about the farthest I can get from describing it. So what is it? It's a style that is modeled after how athletes train. How do they train? They practice. The backbone of ASE is something called the WOD, or workout of the day.

<h2>Workout Of The Day</h2>
The workout of the day consists of a timed exercise. You are given clear and conscise instructions and required to come up with a solution within the prescribed timelimit. If you fail, it is a sign that you need more practice in the areas covered by the workout. 
  
<h2>Why is it good?</h2>
  
Vince Lombardi once said that "Practice does not make perfect, practice makes permanent. Perfect practice makes perfect." I think this applies to this teaching philosphy as well. Learning a programming language requires the ability to problem solve. The WOD clearly promotoes being able to problem solve, and even brings about the idea of deadlines. While we may not make perfect, we can most definitely make permanent a great foundation with ASE.

Another aspect to take into account is after we graduate. The current state of interviewing for a job in software development usually consists of being able to "white board" a problem, which is solving a problem for the interviewer writing out your code on a white board, that is usualy from popular sites like <a href="https://leetcode.com/">leetcode</a>. While this doesn't imitate the experience exactly, but will definitely help prepare for the future.
