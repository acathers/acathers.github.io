<h2> I can't park! </h2>

Coming into UH as a new student and figuring out parking can be an absolute nightmare. You're told you can't apply for
a parking pass until a later date after returning students, which pretty much guarantees you won't have a parking pass.
You can buy one in a zone that requires a shuttle, but honestly, nobody has time for that. 

We propose having a way to sell parking passes that lets students buy parking passes that guarantees them stalls near
their prospective classes. A user could pick between 2 - 4 time blocks for the semester in a multitude of parking stalls.
This would allow a lot more students be able to park on campus.
