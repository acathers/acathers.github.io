<h2> A Different Approach to Parking at UH</h2>

Coming into UH as a new student and figuring out parking can be an absolute nightmare. You're told you can't apply for
a parking pass until a later date after returning students, which pretty much guarantees you won't have a parking pass.
You can buy one in a zone that requires a shuttle, but honestly, nobody has time for that. 

We propose having a way to sell parking passes that lets students buy parking passes that guarantees them stalls near
their prospective classes. A user could pick between 2 - 4 time blocks for the semester in a multitude of parking stalls.
This would allow a lot more students be able to park on campus.

<h2>Mockup / Use Case</h2>
 
<ul>
  <li><b>Landing Page</b>: Login using OAuth/Require UH email &#8594; Routes to account</li>
  <li><b>User Page</b>: Multiple tabs such as manage spaces, purchase.</li>
  <li><b>Purchase Spaces</b>: Allows a user to select from available spaces, and reporting. </li>
  <li><b>Manage Spaces</b>: Allows user to manage already purchased spaces.</li>
  <li><b>Report</b>: Allows user to report unauthorized vehicle in space during their time, possibly give an alternative spot.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Beyond the Basics </h2>

<ul>
  <li>Possible interactive map</li>
  <li>The use of OAuth 2.0 to validate user</li>
  <li>Allow upload of schedule to pick best available spots</li>
 </ul>
