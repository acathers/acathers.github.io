<h1> What is a UI framework? </h1>

<p>A UI framework is a tool we can use to make life easier when designing the front end of a website. It provides a solid 
base of pre-written code that we can draw on to do what we want. If you want a menu bar? It most likely has some of the 
complicated CSS already written out and all you have to do is use the correct class. </p>

<p>So what does a UI framework allow us to do? With about 10 minutes of time you can take your website from looking like
a 1995 angelfire page, to something more modern. For example
</p>
<div class="ui container center aligned">
<img class="ui medium center floated rounded image" src="../images/browserhistory-old.png">
To something more like this
<img class="ui medium center floated rounded image" src="../images/browserhistory-new.png">
</div>

Just looking at that transformation, you'd think someone had to have put a little bit of time into it, at least much more
than the previous version of the site.
