What if you came home and went to go relax with your favorite book. Only, it seems the author somehow magically updated it and decided to go wild with how the formatting of the book was. He decided there would be three spaces 
before periods, commas are outlawed, and 


```js
if(true)console.log("this");if(true)(console.log("is horrid"));
```

You can most likely discern what the above line does, but could you imagine if thousands of lines in a source code did odd and unreadable things like this?
