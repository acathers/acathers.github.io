<h2>Good Questions</h2>

Looking at this example above, you might immediately say you don't know the answer. But, if you had the knowledge, or have done something similiar it would be easy to know if you had the ability to answer this question right off the bat. Everything is presented in a clear and concise matter, and you don't have to ask follow up questions. This poster made it extremely easy for someone to read his question, and formulate a well thought out reponse

<h2>Not-so-good Questions</h2>

So what's wrong with the above question? You could argue that he asked a clear question, but this question really doesn't bring any benefit to anyone. First off, if the submitter had put in even the tiniest amount of effort I'm sure they could have found the answer themselves using just a little bit of google-fu. Even simpler they could have put it through a debugger and stepped through it line by line and watched in real time exactly what was happening. It shows a lack of inititive and desire, and one might even say a bit disrespectful. This poster expects someone else to do all the legwork.

<h2>Why?</h2>

Asking a smart question is an essential tool that will make your life much easier, but also easier on the technical community and your colleagues. Once you learn the art of asking a smart question, the amount of well thought out and useful replies to your questions will almost certainly increase.

Another benefit of asking a smart question is that it forces you to put all of the information down, and that act itself might lead to you having a revelation and solving the problem yourself. It's a little bit like rubber duckie debugging but without the duckie.

<h2>X-Y Questions</h2>

I've been a member of a discord server that's dedicated to helping people with issues for over a year and a half now, one thing that I've learned about asking questions is not to only show what doesn't work, and explain how you've attempted to do it, but exactly what you're attemping to do. So instead of asking how to achieve what your solution to the problem is, attempt to ask it in a way that the community could read the question and come up with an alternative, there might be a way that is a million times better than the solution you thought of. 

If that doesn't explain it, here's a <a href ="http://xyproblem.info/">great website</a> that will!
