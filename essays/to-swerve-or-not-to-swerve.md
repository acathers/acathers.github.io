<h1>Ethics</h1>

<p>What are ethics? I'm sure many people can give examples off the top of their head but it's a bit harder to narrow
it down to a singular definition. Some might get flustered and say something along the lines of "To be ethical is to make ethical decisions!"
Giving a definition with the word you're trying to define in it doesn't usually help much so let us try to define it a bit better.
</p>
<p>
Straight from dictionary ethics are defined as "moral principles that govern a person's behavior or the conducting of an activity." Which is a good definition,
but it leads to more questions. What are moral principles? Who decides what is moral and immoral? I believe morals are simply our own personal definition of right
and wrong. Not everything is black and white, what might seem immoral to one, could be moral to the next. There are of course big topics such as murder that the majority side
with immoral. So I would say that ethics as a whole are what the majority of society deem moral, or right.</p>
