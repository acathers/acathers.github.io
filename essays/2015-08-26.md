At a young age I have always been fascinated by computers. From my first 66mhz computer running DOS to my current PC rocking an Intel Core i7-8700k computers have been my passion. Eleven year old me started off programming during the glory days of Internet Relay Chat(IRC). I would spend countless hours hacking away using the mIRC scripting language to help manage the numerous IRC networks I admin'd on, I was hooked. Despite my passion, I never advanced more than basic scripting until I finished my contract in the military, and started university. Having the time and dedication to devote to programming I have learned one thing, with programming the sky is the limit!

I am now starting to take a Software Engineering class. I hope to learn a lot through the course, but I know it will be just the beginning of my journey. By the time I’m done with it, I hope I’ve learned enough to take the next step in my life as a developer. But until then, my fire will keep on burning.
