At a young age I have always been fascinated by computers. From my first 66mhz computer running DOS to my current PC rocking an Intel Core i7-8700k computers have been my passion. Eleven year old me started off programming during the glory days of Internet Relay Chat(IRC). I would spend countless hours hacking away using the mIRC scripting language to help manage the numerous IRC networks I admin'd on, I was hooked. Despite my passion, I never advanced more than basic scripting until I finished my contract in the military, and started university. Having the time and dedication to devote to programming I have learned one thing, with programming the sky is the limit!

My first programming language I was introduced to was Java. I was a bit negatively biased towards Java at first because I had read numerous articles when Java was first released and it seemed to be the butt of many jokes in the programming world. I quickly learned that it had evolved into an amazing language. First, the documentation is simply amazing. Everything you could possibly want is presented in an easy to read and traceable format. Second the verbosity is perfect for a beginner I believe. 

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
	System.out.println("Hello World");
}
```

The above "Hello World" may be a bit much to grasp at first, but when it clicks everything just makes sense, and it grows on you.

On my journey to becomming a software developer I want to learn how to learn. Computer Science to me is more than just learning to program, but is the study of what computers can do. I want to be able to push the limits in theory and then be able to implement them. My end goal is to be given complex problems and then be able to develop as simple as solutions as possible. The puzzle of how to make a computer do complex tasks just how we want them to do fascinates me.
